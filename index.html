        <h1 class="title">The many ways to build concrete weights</h1>
        <p>Were you wondering to start working out? Have you ever thought of making your own equipment with your creativity? Then you've come to the right website! here on this website we talk about the steps on how you can construct weights with concrete, and how you can make your own concrete to build these weights.</p>

        <p>The first steps you would want to take is to find limestone around your area, if you can't find any limestone near you, you can always substitute oyster shells for limestone! But if you have found limestone, to be sure that you have found limestone you can take vinegar and sprinkle some vinegar onto the rock if it fizzles and bubbles begin to form and begins to sound like a pop, you my friend have found limestone! if you have no vinegar, you can use a coin to scratch the rock and if the scratch leaves imprints you most like likey have limestone but this alternate option is not as accurate to using vinegar. you will also need to use a kiln to heaet the cement in order to use it as concrete.</p>

           <p>first you'd want to buy 18" Plant pot saucer, PVC pipe, Garbage bags, and Paper grocery bags. The following steps may be hard to follow but you'll have to follow these next 12 steps</p>
        
           <h4>1.Place the bag of concrete in your doubled heavy duty garbage bag (You can skip this step and and use a large bucket if you have one.)
 </h4>
<h4>
           2. Cut it open and pour out contents (while still in the garbage bag)
 </h4>
<h4>
           3. Add water (approx 3-4 liters per 30kg bag)
           </h4>

           <h4>
        4. Close the bag with your hand and slosh around with your other hand until mixed. </h4>
<h4>
5. Add it to your mold and then shake the mold (Make sure your mold is over 2 inches thick. Shaking ensures more even distribution. You might want to scrap the top with a flat object until even .) </h4>
<h4>
6. Cut your PVC pipe and press into the center of your mold. (There should be a portion of it still visible above the concrete)
</h4>
           <h4>7. Place a wet grocery bag or towel over the mold and keep it damp.</h4>
               <h4>8. After 24 hours remove from the mold and continue to place the Paper bag or towel over it.
(Use pliers to shake the pipe out)</h4>
                   <h4>9. let it cure (Sit) for 2-3 days. Continue to keep it damp.
(Concrete doesn't dry, but cures. This means it bonds together over time if it's kept damp. If it dries too quickly it will become brittle and crack).
            </h4>
                       <h4>10. Continue to let it dry without dampness for another day or two.
                  </h4>
                           <h4>11. You now have some weights

(You might want to add some duct tape or PVC tubing in the center opening so it doesn't scratch your bar. Another thing to consider is adding concrete fibers or shredded nylon rope to the mix for more strength )
   </h4>
                               <h4>12. Add a cover,
You can also add some kind of covering to keep any dust from the concrete inside. The image is a quickly done garbage bag and duct tape cover with PVC in the center.</h4>

           <h4>Make sure the stand is wide enough, so the dumbbells don't clash Ensure the curved handles are wide enough to hold your dumbbells</h4>
           <h2>Once you've printed my dumbbell plans on 4 sheets A4 sheets of paper YOU:</h2>
           <h4>Overlap the sheets as pictured to match up the reference marks</h4>
           <h4>Print at 100% scale. But, the most important dumbbell spacing to get right are the top two ones, being closer together.</h4>
               <h4>Hold the smallest dumbbells together and leave about a 1cm gap for clearance between the heads and then measure the distance between the two handles. This is the top's width you need before the curves start</h4>
           <h4>Or, you can draw around the two smallest dumbbell's head, cut them out on more paper, and place it on top where they would lie to see if the DIY dumbbell tree rack is big enough. This is especially important for a HEX dumbbell rack</h4>
           <h4>Spread the sheets wider if your dumbbell's heads need more room, but keep the bottom line straight and fill in any gaps with a pencil if needed</h4>
           <h4>Sellotape the sheets together</h4>
           <h4>Note, you might need to draw slightly wider curves for the handles, or file them down later</h4>
           <h4>Cut your dumbbell tree with scissors</h4>
           <h4>You could then place the template over some cardboard and cut two templates out first with scissors again to absolutely make sure it fits</h4>
           <h4>Once you've got a template you're happy with, lay it on your chosen 12mm thick wood* and draw around it</h4>
           <h4>You can then start cutting with your desired tool</h4>
           
           <h3>60cm x 60cm 12mm plywood (above) to draw both sides of my dumbbell tree
40cm x 20cm 12mm plywood* for the base   although, this isn't vital
5 lengths at 6.5cm long of 38mm x 63mm CLS structural timber or similar   the length is usually dictated by the smallest dumbbells, which you'll find are shorter</h3>
           <h1>The most important wood on this list is the structural timber which is usually used in construction for studwork so it can hold your dumbbell's weight. I don't recommend using anything else for this to hold the front and back together, and luckily it's cheap to buy.</h1>
           <h2>OTHER than that that will be my presentation and enjoy LIFTING!</h2>
